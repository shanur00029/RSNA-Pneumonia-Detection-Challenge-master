# RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Challenge-master
Faster R-CNN for RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Challenge Dataset by Keras Introduction   In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, your algorithm needs to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.   The original code of Keras version of Faster R-CNN I used was written by yhenon (resource link: GitHub .) He used the PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets   We have modified the problem statement for our personal learning purpose  We consider only those images which has lables coordinate in stage_2_train_labels.csv   For me, I just used the  RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Challenge Dataset for lungs capacity . I applied configs different from his work to fit my dataset and I removed unuseful code.  #Project Structure   dcm to jpg .ipynb  is the file to tranfom .dcm to jpg images in train and test floder   preposessing.ipynb is the file to preprocessing the  (stage_2_train_labels.csv ) we have drop the values which doesnot conatin any coordinate values ( 0004cfab-14fd-4e49-80ba-63a80b6bddd6,,,,,0 ) I run this part by my own computer because of no need for GPU computation.   frcnn_train_vgg.ipynb is the file to train the model. The configuration and model saved path are inside this file. frcnn_test_vgg.ipynb is the file to test the model with test images and calculate the mAP (mean average precision) for the model.    for training we have used GTX 1650 with 4 gb ram and for 40 epoch it's taken 60 hours approx    Base Model Vgg16   Its a one stage  faster rcnn tranning  model    You can dowload the data set from kaggle compition  https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge
